## 🎨 **Customization**

### **Change the Model**
Edit line 165 in `index.html`:
```javascript
model: 'phi3:mini', // Change to 'llama2:7b', 'mistral:7b', etc.
```

### **Customize the Appearance**
- **Colors**: Edit the CSS gradient in the `<style>` section
- **Title**: Change "Personal Assistant AI" to whatever you want
- **Avatar**: Modify the message avatars ("AI", "You")

### **Add Authentication**
If your LLM requires authentication, modify the fetch request:
```javascript
headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-token-here'
}
```

## 📱 **Mobile-Friendly**

The interface automatically adapts to mobile devices:
- ✅ Touch-friendly buttons
- ✅ Responsive layout
- ✅ Easy typing on small screens
- ✅ Configuration panel moves to top on mobile

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Cannot connect to your LLM service"**
- ✅ Make sure your LLM is deployed and running
- ✅ Check the URL is correct (copy from deployment output)
- ✅ Ensure the service allows unauthenticated access

### **"No response received"**
- ✅ Your model might be loading (first request can be slow)
- ✅ Try a simpler question
- ✅ Check the browser console for errors (F12)

### **Slow responses**
- ✅ First request after idle time takes longer (cold start)
- ✅ Subsequent requests should be faster
- ✅ Consider using a smaller model for faster responses
